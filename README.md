# WWYE - What would you encrypt?

## Overview
The "What would you encrypt?" series is a developer education campaign that
covers common transaction payloads that are useful to encrypt.

Code in this repository uses `dwrite` from `seismic-client` to create example
transactions. This is purely client-side. Transactions are not sent to any
network.

## Run
```
bun install
bun rent  # see package.json for all the example options
```
