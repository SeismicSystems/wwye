# WWYE - What will you encrypt?

## Overview
The "What will you encrypt?" series is a developer education campaign that
covers common transaction payloads that are useful to encrypt.

Code in this repository uses debug write from `seismic-client` to create example
transactions that aren't sent to any network.

## Run
```
bun install
bun rent  # see package.json for all the example options
```
